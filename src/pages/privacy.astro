          We set a persistent cookie to store your email address, so you don’t
          have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to
          track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience
          on our site.

          Will my personal and account information be provided to any other
          party?
        </h3>
        <p>
          We restrict access to your personal and account information to those
          who need access to use it as set forth in this policy. Your personal
          and account information will never be sold, shared, rented or traded
          to third parties except under the following circumstances:
        </p>
        <p>
          We may disclose your personal and account information to respond to
          subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process, as required by law,
          or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal
          claims.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may disclose your personal and account information when we believe
          it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of
          SharpSeat, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information
          with other companies, organizations, or agents of the customer for
          fraud protection. However, this does not include selling, renting,
          sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information
          for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in
          this Privacy Policy.

          another company.
